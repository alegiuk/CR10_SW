# CR 10 to Switchwire Conversion
This is a conversion of the CR 10/10s to a Voron Switchwire, this project has been possibile thank to the amazing work of <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire">Gizzzle</a> , <a href="https://github.com/walttriano/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Triano/Ender_3Pro_Switchwire">Triano</a> e altri progetti per quetsa conversione e grazie hai fantastici membri della voron communty. ho voluto fare questo progetto perchè 2 anni fa quando ho inziato questa conversione non ho trovato progetti ben fatti e completi quidni rilascio questo progetto dopo 2 anni sia per impegni scolaici sia perchè volevo rilasciare un progetto completo e finito. 

(per assemblare questa conversione potete usare la guida originale per la <a href="https://vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire">Voron Switchwire</a> e i fantastici video di <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRsIVaP-BizCdEONPhoDoOAeQk3QzMPTN">GoldenJagaur3D</a>)

## General

Various parts can be recycled from the CR 10/10s, most important ones are:
- The frame (though a 380mm extrusion is needed for the X. You can chop the original one to length).
- The stock PSU.
- The heatbed assemble.
- Z motors (i suggest to uprade even this one to stepper online ones).
- All the cables that don't go through the cable-chains (for there, silicone or PTFE cable is adviced).
- 4010 fan for the tool cooling.

*cheaping out in parts can lead into several problems, such as poor printing quality or, even worse, safety hazard. Keep that in mind and use parts from the official Switchwire BOM.

## BOM with extra parts you will need
The BOM added is based on the baseline Switchwire one, it has has the most important parts for this mod

## Files

- Most of the printed part files needed for this conversion, are included in this git (you will only need to get the Afterburner print files from the [official Switchwire git](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Switchwire/tree/master/STL/Gantry/XZ_Axis/X_Carriage) ).
- CAD files (.f3d and .STEP) are provided, in order to help the building process, but they also serve as a BOM (in case you need to find proper screw lengths etc).
- DXF files in order to cut your enclosure panels.
- A printer.cfg as a starting point (based off LDO motors and SKR E3 mini V2 board).
