# CR 10 to Switchwire Conversion
This is a conversion of the CR 10/10s to a Voron Switchwire, this project has been possibile thanks to the amazing work and help of other members of the voron community. The motivation came from his awesome original conversion that was used as a starting point, however almost everything was re-designed from scratch (in order to follow the Voron guidelines and aesthetics more accurately). Another factor that led to this re-design, was the need to be able to enclose this printer in a, visually, pleasant and, structurally, functional way. The ingenious design of 5x MGN12H Linear Rails - 300mm (dual Y axis rail) from Triano was preserved and the printing volume is ~220x220x220.
