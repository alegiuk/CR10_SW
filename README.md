# CR 10 to Switchwire Conversion
This is a conversion of the CR 10/10s to a Voron Switchwire, this project has been possibile thank to the amazing work of <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire/">Gizzzle</a> , <a href="[https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire](https://github.com/walttriano/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Triano/Ender_3Pro_Switchwire)/">Triano</a> e altri progetti per quetsa conversione e grazie hai fantastici membri della voron communty. ho voluto fare questo progetto perch√® 2 anni fa quando ho inziato questa . Another factor that led to this re-design, was the need to be able to enclose this printer in a, visually, pleasant and, structurally, functional way. The ingenious design of 5x MGN12H Linear Rails - 300mm (dual Y axis rail) from Triano was preserved and the printing volume is ~220x220x220.
