# CR 10 to Switchwire Conversion
This is the conversion from a CR 10/10s to a Voron Switchwire, this was possible thanks to the amazing work of <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire">Gizzzle</a> , <a href="https://github.com/walttriano/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Triano/Ender_3Pro_Switchwire">Walttriano</a> And other projects for this conversion and thanks to the fantastic members of the voron community. This is a very carefuly designed build. However mistakes could have been made so by deciding to follow this conversion, you are responsible for any possible damage done to the printer or even yourself. This is serious so keep that in mind.

(To complete this conversion you can use the original guide for the <a href="https://vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire">Voron Switchwire</a> and the videos of <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRsIVaP-BizCdEONPhoDoOAeQk3QzMPTN">GoldenJaguar3D</a> That were essential to me)

## Info
The original parts of the printer that you will need:
- Stock frame (though a 380mm extrusion is needed for the X. You can chop the original one to length).
- Stock PSU.
- Stock heatbed assemble.
- ZYX stepper (i recommend upgrading all the motors to stepper online ones).
- For cables that pass through the drag chains it is recommended to put silicone or PTFE ones


## BOM
The BOM has all the parts you will need to complete this conversion, do not worry if at the end you will have spare screws, inserts and t-nuts, I put the quantities a little higher for safety. for the links from which to take the parts I recommend you look at the original BOM of the <a href="https://vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire">Voron Switchwire</a>

## Config
It's the .config file that i use on my printer that you can use as a base (the parameters set are those for the parts I am using)

## CAD/STL
The files that you will need to print are included in the STL folder, I also attach the CAD (.step and .f3d) models useful during assembly

## Images
Images of both the 3d model and my physical printer



In case of any problem or difficulty contact me on discord alegiuk#7901 or to mark errors / problems with the repository or 3d files. I do not consider myself for any reason an expert but only a 17 year old with this hobby, any advice or changes will be warmly appreciated.
