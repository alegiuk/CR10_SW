# CR 10 to Switchwire Conversion
This is a conversion of the CR 10/10s to a Voron Switchwire, for this project as been inspired from the amazing work of <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire/">Gizzzle</a> . The motivation came from his awesome original conversion that was used as a starting point, however almost everything was re-designed from scratch (in order to follow the Voron guidelines and aesthetics more accurately). Another factor that led to this re-design, was the need to be able to enclose this printer in a, visually, pleasant and, structurally, functional way. The ingenious design of 5x MGN12H Linear Rails - 300mm (dual Y axis rail) from Triano was preserved and the printing volume is ~220x220x220.
